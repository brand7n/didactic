** v1.0 - 4-Sep-2002
- FIXED interlocks between combinations of incompatible instructions are not implemented
- FIXED parser doesn't accept a symbol (or expr starting with symbol) as instruction (unless after label)
- FIXED I/O instructions are not yet entered in initial symbol table
- FIXED object code is not written to a file
- pseudo-instructions are largely unimplemented
- symbol table dump at end of assembly is not sorted
- FIXED no facility to generate a conventional listing file (i.e. annotated with original source lines)
- improve source code commentary
- check all constants and predefined tables for correctness

- FIXED A-B is not parsed correctly (negate takes precedence over subtract?!)
- expression operators are a bit skimpy (only add, subtract, negate)
- FIXED lower case is rejected as illegal; perhaps should input be case-insensitive?
- MOSTLY FIXED no native DG Nova object file output
