I'm not writing a disassembler, or an editor, nor am I going to change editors (I'm not using an Intel box anyway). I do not want to design a colour scheme from first colour theoretic and psychometric principles (thanks Beth) either. Even if I came up with a very effective result, it would probably be completely inconsistent with existing schemes, and that would defeat part of my purpose.

I was hoping to gather the best ideas from the existing schemes. Thanks for the suggestions.

To that end, here's what I discovered.
